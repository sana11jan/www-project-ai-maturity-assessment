### Architecture Assessment
DRAFT

#### Introduction

The AIMA Architecture Assessment practice ensures AI system architectures consistently adhere to best practices, industry standards, and emerging security guidelines. Regular assessments help identify architectural weaknesses early, fostering robust, secure, and ethically compliant AI solutions.

#### Objectives

- Regularly validate AI architectures against evolving standards and best practices.
- Identify and remediate architectural vulnerabilities.
- Continuously refine AI system architectures based on assessment insights.

| Maturity Level | Stream A – Conduct Architecture Reviews | Stream B – Measure and Improve Architecture |
|----------------|---------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **1 – Initial** | - Architecture reviews informal or ad hoc.<br>- Limited awareness of AI-specific architecture standards.<br>- Reactive to architecture-related incidents rather than proactive assessments. | - Few or no metrics related to architectural quality or security.<br>- Irregular documentation of assessment outcomes.<br>- Limited stakeholder engagement or reporting. |
| **2 – Managed** | - Defined architecture review process integrated into AI projects.<br>- Clearly assigned responsibilities for architecture assessments.<br>- Regular architecture evaluations aligned with lifecycle milestones. | - Established metrics (compliance with architectural guidelines, identified vulnerabilities, remediation rates).<br>- Routine reporting to stakeholders.<br>- Metrics actively guide architecture improvements. |
| **3 – Optimizing** | - Comprehensive and continuous architecture assessment embedded in the AI lifecycle.<br>- Proactive identification and remediation of architectural vulnerabilities.<br>- Active adaptation to emerging AI architectural best practices and guidelines. | - Advanced metrics and analytics for real-time architectural monitoring.<br>- Predictive analytics proactively identifying potential architectural weaknesses.<br>- Strong organizational commitment to continuous architectural refinement driven by actionable metrics insights. |
