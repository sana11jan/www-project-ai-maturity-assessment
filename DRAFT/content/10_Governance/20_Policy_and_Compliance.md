## Policy and Compliance  

The **Policy & Compliance** practice translates high-level AI-security and Responsible-AI principles into concrete rules and oversight mechanisms. By formalizing AI-specific policies—and continuously verifying that systems, data, and processes comply with internal standards and external regulations—organizations reduce legal exposure, safeguard user trust, and uphold ethical commitments. Effective policy frameworks provide clear guidance to data scientists and engineers, while structured compliance activities (risk assessments, audits, attestations) create documented evidence that AI initiatives operate within agreed security, privacy, and fairness boundaries.  

### Objectives  

- **Define and Maintain AI-Specific Policies & Standards** that cover security, privacy, ethics, and quality across the AI lifecycle.  
- **Ensure and Demonstrate Compliance** with applicable laws, regulations, and internal governance requirements.  
- **Drive Continuous Policy Improvement** through regular reviews, monitoring, and automation of enforcement and assurance activities.  

#### Policy and Compliance  

| Maturity Level | Stream A – Develop & Enforce Policies | Stream B – Compliance & Risk Oversight |
|----------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **1 – Establish Baseline AI Policies and Compliance Awareness** to address foundational security, privacy, and ethical obligations. | - **Minimal AI-Specific Policies:** AI risks are loosely covered by general IT/security policies, if at all.<br/>- **Reactive Updates:** Policies change only after incidents or regulatory pressure.<br/>- **Limited Guidance:** Teams lack clear instructions for secure or responsible AI development. | - **Reactive Compliance:** Efforts focus on ad-hoc responses to audits or incidents.<br/>- **Limited Oversight:** No systematic tracking of AI-related regulations or risks.<br/>- **Informal Risk Assessment:** Assessments, when performed, are inconsistent and undocumented. |
| **2 – Document and Enforce AI Policies, and Implement Structured Compliance Processes** for security, privacy, and ethics. | - **Documented AI Policies & Standards:** Formal requirements cover data use, model validation, bias testing, explainability, etc.<br/>- **Periodic Reviews:** Policies reviewed on a defined schedule or when major changes occur.<br/>- **Consistent Application:** Projects follow standards; exceptions require documented approval. | - **Established Compliance Processes:** Regular reviews (privacy impact, bias audits) align with known regulations (e.g., GDPR, AI Act).<br/>- **Consistent Risk Framework:** A risk register tracks AI security and ethical posture across projects.<br/>- **Internal Audit & Reporting:** Findings are reported to governance bodies; remediation is tracked. |
| **3 – Continuously Optimize Policies and Compliance Governance** with proactive monitoring, benchmarking, and automation. | - **Integrated Policy Framework:** AI policies embedded in enterprise governance, risk, and ethics programs.<br/>- **Proactive Evolution:** Updates anticipate emerging threats and regulations, guided by continuous risk scanning and industry input.<br/>- **Automated Enforcement:** CI/CD gates, data-use controls, and policy-as-code tooling flag or block non-compliant artifacts automatically. | - **Holistic Compliance Integration:** Real-time regulatory watchlists inform automatic updates to controls and checklists.<br/>- **Advanced Risk Analytics:** Continuous monitoring detects drift, bias, or security anomalies that could trigger compliance breaches.<br/>- **Benchmarking & Certification:** The organization measures itself against leading frameworks and pursues external attestations to demonstrate excellence. |

|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Level 1**     | Identify and document governance and compliance drivers relevant to the org.    | Identify 3rd-party compliance drivers and requirements. Map to existing policies & standards. |
| **Level 2**     | Establish AI-specific policy and compliance baselines.                         | Publish compliance-specific AI requirements and test guidance.                            |
| **Level 3**     | Measure adherence to internal policies, standards, and external requirements.   | Report individual system’s compliance with 3rd-party requirements and internal standards.  |
