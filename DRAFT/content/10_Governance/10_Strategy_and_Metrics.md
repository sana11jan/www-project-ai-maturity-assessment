# Draft: Governance - Strategy and Metrics

| Maturity Level | Stream A - Create and Promote | Stream B - Measure and Improve |
|----------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| **1 - Establish an AI Security and Responsible AI Strategy** aligned with the organization’s overall business goals, ethical standards, and risk profile. | - **Minimal Alignment:** AI security and RAI efforts are not consistently linked to business or ethical goals.<br>- **Unclear Accountability:** No formal ownership for AI security or ethical governance; responsibilities may be scattered.<br>- **Ad Hoc Processes:** AI security actions happen on-demand (e.g., after an incident), with no strategic roadmap. | - **No Formal Metrics:** AI security and RAI outcomes (e.g., incident counts, bias incidents, model validation) are not measured or measured informally.<br>- **Incident-Driven Insights:** Data is gathered primarily after security or ethical incidents with no routine analysis.<br>- **Lack of Standardization:** Reporting varies widely, making organization-wide comparisons difficult. |
| **2 - Define and Track AI Security and RAI Metrics** to measure effectiveness, maturity, fairness, transparency, and return on investment. | - **Documented Strategy:** A formal AI security and RAI strategy exists, referencing relevant enterprise risk, compliance, and ethical needs.<br>- **Clear Governance:** Defined roles (AI Security Lead, AI Ethics Officer, AI Security Committee) ensure accountability, fairness, and decision-making.<br>- **Planned Integration:** AI security and ethical oversight efforts included in project roadmaps, budgets, and organizational planning. | - **Established Metric Set:** KPIs/KRIs (e.g., fairness metrics, model risk classification, explainability standards) tracked over time.<br>- **Regular Collection & Reporting:** Metrics gathered at intervals and shared with stakeholders through dashboards/reports.<br>- **Action-Oriented Insights:** Metrics drive resource allocation, ethical policies, fairness improvements, and actions for regulatory compliance. |
| **3 - Continuously Improve AI Security and RAI Posture** through iterative learning, adaptation, and ethical alignment. | - **Fully Embedded:** AI security and RAI strategy integrated into broader corporate governance and ethics frameworks, continuously updated.<br>- **Executive Sponsorship:** Senior leadership proactively supports AI security and responsible AI as strategic investments.<br>- **Lifecycle Integration:** Mandatory AI security controls (model audits, fairness assessments, transparency measures, human oversight protocols) throughout all AI development and deployment phases. | - **Advanced Analytics & Monitoring:** Real-time monitoring of AI systems (data drift, adversarial attack detection, bias detection), automated alerts, and comprehensive audit trails.<br>- **Predictive & Preventive Metrics:** Metrics forecast risks (ethical, security, compliance issues) proactively addressing concerns.<br>- **Culture of Data-Driven and Ethical Governance:** Metrics feed strategic decision-making; clear processes for continuous feedback, fairness enhancements, transparency improvements, and regulatory compliance. |
