# Governance

Artificial-intelligence systems introduce **unique governance challenges** that go well beyond those of traditional software:

* **Non-deterministic behaviour** – Predictions can drift as data or context change, requiring continuous oversight.  
* **Opaque decision logic** – Complex models make it hard to explain outcomes, raising regulatory, ethical, and reputational risks.  
* **Data-centric attack surface** – Poisoned or biased data can silently compromise security and fairness before a single line of code is written.  
* **Rapidly evolving regulation** – Frameworks such as the EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF, and ISO 42001 demand traceable risk controls throughout the model lifecycle.

The **Governance pillar** of the **OWASP AI Maturity Assessment (AIMA)** equips organisations to meet these challenges by embedding a closed-loop system of **direction, control, and enablement** across every AI initiative. It is built around three mutually reinforcing practices:

1. **Strategy & Metrics** – Define a forward-looking AI-security and Responsible-AI vision, map it to business value and risk appetite, and quantify progress with model-aware KPIs/KRIs (e.g., adversarial-robustness scores, bias indices, model-lifecycle coverage).  
2. **Policy & Compliance** – Translate strategy into enforceable, AI-specific standards (data provenance, model transparency, human-in-the-loop thresholds) and continuously prove conformance to internal and external requirements.  
3. **Education & Guidance** – Ensure every actor in the AI supply chain—from prompt engineer to board director—has the role-tailored knowledge, playbooks, and real-time guardrails needed to make secure, ethical decisions.

Together these practices create a **governance engine** that:

* **Connects intent to execution** – Policies, controls, and training all trace back to strategic AI-risk objectives.  
* **Enforces “shift-left” accountability** – Requirements are embedded in data pipelines, model cards, and CI/CD gates, not bolted on after deployment.  
* **Drives measurable improvement** – Continuous metrics expose blind spots, inform investment, and demonstrate due diligence to auditors and regulators.

By assessing maturity against the Governance pillar, organisations can chart a clear, incremental path from **ad-hoc experimentation** to **institutionalised, trustworthy AI**—unlocking innovation while safeguarding users, regulators, and the business itself.
