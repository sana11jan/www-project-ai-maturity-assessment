## Defect Management

### Objectives
Continuously identify, categorize, and mitigate AI-specific defects, improving model quality, operational reliability, and reducing potential ethical or legal harm.

| **Maturity Level** | **Stream A – Process-Oriented**                                                                       | **Stream B – Technical Controls**                                                                                               |
|--------------------|:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Level 1**        | **AI Defect Tracking**:<br>- Introduce taxonomy for AI defects.<br>- Track model behavior issues.     | **Issue Identification and Feedback**:<br>- Monitor feedback and perform basic regression testing.                              |
| **Level 2**        | **Prioritization of AI Defects**:<br>- Score impact and integrate into QA.<br>- Track defect metrics. | **Targeted AI Testing**:<br>- Test edge cases and fairness.<br>- Reevaluate model behavior regularly.                           |
| **Level 3**        | **Root Cause Analysis**:<br>- Investigate training/data issues.<br>- Document lessons learned.        | **Automated Defect Response**:<br>- Automate retraining/rollback.<br>- Use anomaly detection.<br>- Enable closed-loop learning. |

Effective defect management in AI systems demands more than traditional bug tracking. It must extend to monitoring for ethical failures (e.g., biased outputs), reliability issues (e.g., hallucinations), and security vulnerabilities (e.g., model inversion attacks). Additionally, organizations should aim for proactive identification of emerging risks through user feedback, anomaly detection, and adaptive testing strategies that evolve alongside the deployed AI solutions.

This implementation extension provides actionable practices for teams incorporating AI systems into software while maintaining alignment with the overall security maturity model. Organizations that internalize these practices will be better equipped to responsibly leverage AI technologies while managing their associated risks with transparency and resilience.

### Metrics
* Number of AI defects identified post-deployment
* Percentage of AI issues triaged with defined severity
* Time to resolution for critical AI-related issues
