## Secure Build

### Objectives
Establish secure integration of AI/LLM components by promoting responsible sourcing, secure coding, resilient design, and defensible supply chain choices.

| **Maturity Level** | **Stream A – Process-Oriented**                                                                                                                          | **Stream B – Technical Controls**                                                                                                              |

| **Level 1**        | **AI Model Inventory**: <br>- Select reliable model sources. <br>- Maintain documented AI inventory. <br>- Track sources and intended use of each model. | **Dependency and Licensing Checks**:<br>- Scan for known vulnerabilities.<br>- Verify license terms and compliance.                            |
| **Level 2**        | **Secure AI Development Guidelines**: <br>- Define secure coding and data handling practices. <br>- Perform AI-specific code reviews.                    | **AI Component Hardening**:<br>- Implement input/output sanitization.<br>- Use version control for models and datasets.<br>- Validate outputs. |
| **Level 3**        | **AI Supply Chain Risk Management**:<br>- Conduct risk assessments. <br>- Maintain asset custody and request attestations.                               | **Adversarial Robustness and Resilience**:<br>- Perform adversarial testing.<br>- Integrate checks in CI/CD.<br>- Test edge-case behavior.     |
