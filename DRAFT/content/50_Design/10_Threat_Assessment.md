## Threat Assessment 
DRAFT

### Introduction

The **Threat Assessment** practice addresses unique security, ethical, and operational risks associated with Large Language Models (LLMs). Given their dynamic nature and extensive interaction with end-users, LLMs introduce specific vulnerabilities such as prompt injection, data leakage, and harmful or unethical outputs. This practice aims to proactively identify, assess, and mitigate these threats systematically, ensuring LLMs are secure, trustworthy, and aligned with organizational values.

### Objective

- **Identify and mitigate threats unique to LLMs** (e.g., OWASP Top 10 for LLM).

### Streams

| Maturity Level | Stream A – LLM Risk Profile | Stream B – Adversarial Threat Modeling |
|----------------|-----------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **1 – Initial Identification of LLM-specific Risks** | - **High-Level Risks Identified:** Initial identification and acknowledgment of broad risks (e.g., data leakage, unethical or harmful outputs).<br>- **Ad Hoc Documentation:** Risks are documented informally, without standardized structures or severity ratings.<br>- **Limited Stakeholder Awareness:** General awareness among stakeholders regarding potential risks, but no systematic tracking. | - **Use of Basic Checklists:** Teams utilize basic threat checklists (e.g., OWASP Top 10 for LLMs) to identify common issues like prompt injection or sensitive data exposure.<br>- **Informal Approach:** Threat identification relies primarily on manual, informal processes.<br>- **Limited Coverage:** Threat assessments cover only selected or high-visibility LLM deployments. |
| **2 – Centralized and Standardized Risk Management** | - **Centralized Risk Inventory:** Established and maintained comprehensive risk inventory specific to LLM use cases, detailing vulnerabilities such as adversarial attacks, prompt manipulation, and ethical concerns.<br>- **Severity Scores:** Risks assigned severity scores based on potential impact, likelihood, and organizational context.<br>- **Regular Updates:** Risk inventories updated periodically or when significant changes in LLM use cases occur. | - **Standardized Threat Modeling Process:** Organization-wide standardized approach to threat modeling, clearly mapping adversarial attack vectors such as prompt injection, unauthorized data disclosure, and unethical content generation.<br>- **Structured Documentation:** Threat models documented systematically and reviewed regularly.<br>- **Integrated into Development:** Threat modeling integrated into the design phase of LLM projects. |
| **3 – Automated and Proactive Risk Detection** | - **Automated Risk Monitoring:** Continuous, automated detection and monitoring of LLM outputs for potentially harmful content, data leakage, and security anomalies.<br>- **Real-time Alerting:** Automated alerts triggered by identified risks, facilitating immediate investigation and mitigation.<br>- **Continuous Improvement:** Risks dynamically reassessed through continuous monitoring and real-time data analytics. | - **Full Automation of Threat Detection:** AI-driven tools automatically detect adversarial attempts, prompt injection attacks, and other security threats in real-time.<br>- **Integrated Alerts into Operational Tools:** Threat detection integrated into operational and incident response systems (e.g., SIEM, SOAR).<br>- **Predictive Analytics:** AI-assisted predictive analytics anticipate new or evolving threats based on historical data and emerging trends. |

### Metrics

- **Percentage (%) of LLM use cases with documented risk profiles.**
- **Mean time to detect adversarial inputs.**
- **Number of detected risks.**
