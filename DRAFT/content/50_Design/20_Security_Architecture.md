## Design – Security Architecture 
DRAFT

### Introduction

The **Security Architecture for AI** practice focuses on designing and implementing robust, secure infrastructure specifically tailored for deploying and monitoring artificial intelligence (AI) systems. AI systems, due to their complexity, evolving threat landscape, and dynamic operational characteristics, require tailored architectural safeguards to mitigate vulnerabilities, ensure reliable operation, and enable rapid incident response. By embedding secure deployment patterns and comprehensive monitoring within the infrastructure, organizations can proactively address threats and maintain continuous protection of their AI-based systems.

### Objective

- **Design secure infrastructure for AI deployment and continuous monitoring.**

### Streams

| Maturity Level | Stream A – Secure Model Deployment | Stream B – Technology Stack Security |
|----------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| **1 – Initial Secure Practices** | - **Basic Isolation & Access Control:** Implement fundamental security measures such as authentication and rate-limiting to secure AI APIs, aligned with industry standards and best practices.<br>- **Limited Runtime Protection:** Initial protections mainly focused on basic perimeter defenses and simple access restrictions. | - **Baseline Security Features:** Utilize frameworks, libraries, and platforms with built-in security functionalities and protections.<br>- **Informal Selection Criteria:** Basic awareness in selecting technology stacks that provide foundational security capabilities. |
| **2 – Standardized Deployment Safeguards** | - **Runtime Guardrails:** Deploy comprehensive runtime guardrails including output sanitization and input validation to mitigate common vulnerabilities (e.g., OWASP Top 10 for AI).<br>- **Structured Deployment Processes:** Standardize deployment procedures to ensure consistent application of security controls across all AI environments. | - **Standardized Monitoring & Observability:** Implement standardized monitoring tools that track performance, observability, and key security metrics, providing clear visibility into AI operational health.<br>- **Regular Metrics Review:** Structured review processes established for ongoing monitoring and maintenance of technology stack security. |
| **3 – Advanced and Proactive Defenses** | - **AI-Driven Adversarial Detection:** Integrate advanced, AI-driven anomaly detection and adversarial monitoring capabilities into deployment environments, proactively identifying and addressing threats in real-time.<br>- **Model Versioning & Rollback:** Implement model versioning with swift rollback mechanisms to enable rapid incident recovery and response, particularly relevant for private or fine-tuned deployments. | - **Automated Patch Management & Scanning:** Fully automate vulnerability scanning and patch management processes, regularly reviewing and securing all dependencies within the technology stack.<br>- **Continuous Improvement Cycles:** Establish continuous review cycles, automatically adapting security practices in response to emerging threats and updated security intelligence. |

### Metrics

- **Percentage (%) of API endpoints secured with proper authentication and rate limiting.**
- **Mean time to patch known vulnerabilities.**
- **Ratio of benign anomalies to confirmed security incidents.**
