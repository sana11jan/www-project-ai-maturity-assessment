# Design

### Introduction  

The **Design** pillar focuses on proactively integrating security and ethical considerations into the fundamental architecture and conceptualization of AI systems. AI introduces new vulnerabilities such as adversarial attacks and requires careful threat assessment and secure architecture decisions from the earliest stages.

To manage these challenges, this pillar includes three core practices:

1. **Threat Assessment** – Systematically identifying and addressing AI-specific threats, including adversarial manipulation and data poisoning.

2. **Security Architecture** – Designing robust and resilient architectures tailored to protect AI systems and their data, leveraging proven security principles like defense-in-depth.

3. **Security Requirements** – Clearly defining explicit AI-related security requirements at the design phase, informed by threat modeling outcomes.
