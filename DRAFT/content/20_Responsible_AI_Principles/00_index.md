# Responsible AI

The **Responsible AI Principles** pillar addresses the distinct ethical and societal implications that arise specifically from artificial intelligence. While traditional software primarily focuses on functionality and security, AI systems introduce unique risks around fairness, transparency, and broader societal impacts. The opacity of AI decision-making processes, the potential for unintended biases in training data, and the wide-ranging effects of AI-driven outcomes on society necessitate dedicated governance.

To meet these challenges, this pillar focuses on three core practices:

1. **Fairness and Bias** – Proactively identifying, mitigating, and continuously monitoring biases within AI systems to ensure fair treatment and equitable outcomes across diverse user groups.

2. **Transparency and Explainability** – Providing meaningful insights into AI decisions, ensuring stakeholders can understand, trust, and appropriately challenge automated outcomes, facilitating accountability.

3. **Ethical and Societal Impact** – Systematically assessing the broader ethical considerations and societal consequences of deploying AI systems, actively managing risks, and aligning AI deployment with organizational values and public expectations.

Together, these practices foster responsible innovation, build user trust, reduce reputational risk, and ensure alignment with regulatory requirements and societal values.
