# Operations

### Introduction  

The **Operations** pillar focuses on securely maintaining AI systems after deployment. Given the complexity and continuous nature of AI operations—including model updates, real-time inference, and dynamic data flows—organizations require dedicated operational practices to manage risks and ensure ongoing reliability, security, and ethical integrity.

This pillar includes three primary practices:

1. **Incident Management** – Establishing rapid-response protocols and capabilities to effectively handle and mitigate security incidents involving AI systems, such as data breaches or model manipulation.

2. **Event Management** – Continuously monitoring AI systems for anomalous behavior, performance degradation, or unexpected outcomes to proactively identify issues.

3. **Operational Management** – Managing and maintaining AI deployments securely, responsibly, and sustainably, ensuring they operate effectively and ethically over time.
